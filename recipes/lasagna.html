  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>
    Here is a recipe that I found for a hyopthetical lasagna while
    working through the Odin Project. I have never tried this recipe
    and I don't really plan on trying it, but it was for the project.
  </p>
  <p>
    To be honest, I'm not really sure how I feel about lasanga. I don't
    quiet get the hype around it. Maybe we had it too much growing up
    or maybe I am just out of touch. Either way, the tutorial asked me
    to write two paragraphs to practice using the paragraph tag, so this
    should be enough, right?

  <h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in a Dutch
       oven over medium heat until well browned. Stir in crushed 
       tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water. Season with 
       sugar, 2 tablespoons parsley, basil, 1 teaspoon salt, Italian 
       seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper. Simmer, covered, for 
       about 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.</li>
      <br>
    <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook 
      lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain 
      noodles, and rinse with cold water. In a mixing bowl, combine 
      ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2 tablespoons parsley, 
      and 1/2 teaspoon salt.</li>
      <br>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
      <br>
    <li>To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom 
      of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over 
      meat sauce. Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top
      with 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 1/2 cups
      meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan 
      cheese. Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella 
      and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking,
      either spray foil with cooking spray or make sure the foil 
      does not touch the cheese.</li>
      <br>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil 
      and bake for an additional 25 minutes. Rest lasagna for 15 
      minutes before serving.</li>
  </ol>
