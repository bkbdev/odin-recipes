    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>[From Wikipedia]</strong>Inexpensive and portable, Spam 
        musubi are commonly found near cash registers in convenience 
        stores or mom-and-pop shops all over Hawaii, Guam and Hawaiian 
        Barbecue restaurants in the mainland United States.[1] Musubi can 
        be easily made with the right materials, and typically only uses 
        spam, rice, some salt, nori and shoyu (soy sauce). In Hawaii, 
        musubi made from homemade spam is served on catering trays at 
        formal events by celebrity chefs such as Alan Wong at his 
        exclusive restaurants.

        <li>2 cups water</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons rice vinegar</li>
        <li>1/2 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>1/4 cup soy sauce</li>
        <li>1/4 cup oyster sauce</li>
        <li>1 (12 oz) can of Spam</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>

    <br>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <br>
    <ol>
        <li>Soak uncooked rice in water to cover for 4 hours; 
            drain and rinse.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Bring 2 cups water to a boil in a medium saucepan. 
            Add rice and stir. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer for 
            20 minutes.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Remove pan from heat and stir in rice vinegar. Set aside
            to cool.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Stir together sugar, soy sauce, and oyster sauce in a 
            medium bowl until sugar is completely dissolved. Slice 
            luncheon meat lengthwise into 10 slices, or to desired 
            thickness, and marinate in sauce for 5 minutes.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook 
            slices until lightly browned, about 2 minutes per side.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Cut nori sheets in half and lay on a flat work surface. 
            Place a rice press in the center of a sheet, and press 
            rice tightly inside. Top with a slice of luncheon meat, 
            and remove press. Wrap nori around rice, sealing edges 
            with a small amount of water. (Rice may also be formed 
            by hand in the shape of the meat slices and about 1-inch 
            thick.)</li>
        <br>
